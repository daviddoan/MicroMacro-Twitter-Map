MicroMacro-Twitter-Map
======================

// A map showing twitter posts with certain keywords. 

Done as a MIT Design Across Scales project involving data.

This shows a google map with real time updates of tweets of certain keywords (in this case, Ukraine). These tweets will be shown as a purple, opaque circle. The radius of this cirlce is proportional the number of followers that tweeter has, showing the reach and influence of that tweet. You can also rollover the circle to see the twitter name and post.
